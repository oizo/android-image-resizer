# Android image resizer

Have you ever tried creating all needed drawables for an android project? It sucks, and updating them sucks even more. So I decided to do a simple script converting SVG files into all the drawables you need.

### Basic usage
Nothing to it really:

`android-image-resizer width input.svg output.png`

This will create all folders needed and place a scaled `output.png` in each
